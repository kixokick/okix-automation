# Setting Up a Node.js Environment for Running the Code

To run the provided Puppeteer code, you need to set up a Node.js environment on your system. Puppeteer is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium browsers. Here are the steps to set up a Node.js environment:

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

If you haven't already, you need to install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager). You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, open your command line or terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

These commands should display the installed Node.js and npm versions, respectively.

## Step 2: Create a Project Directory

Create a new directory where you'll store your Node.js project files. You can do this using your operating system's file explorer or the command line. For example, to create a directory named "puppeteer-example," open your terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir puppeteer-example
cd puppeteer-example
```

## Step 3: Initialize a Node.js Project

Inside your project directory, you should initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a `package.json` file that will keep track of your project's dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

The `-y` flag automatically accepts the default values for the project configuration. You can edit the `package.json` file later if needed.

## Step 4: Install Puppeteer

Now, you need to install Puppeteer as a project dependency. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install puppeteer
```

This will download and install Puppeteer and its dependencies for your project.

## Step 5: Copy and Run the Provided Code

Copy the provided code snippet into a JavaScript file (e.g., `puppeteer-script.js`) within your project directory. Make sure to replace the URL (`https://www.okx.com/account/register`) with the target URL you want to automate.

Now, you can run your Puppeteer script using Node.js. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
node puppeteer-script.js
```

The script will launch a headless Chrome browser, navigate to the specified URL, interact with the web page elements, and perform the actions described in the code.

Make sure you have a stable internet connection and a computer with sufficient resources to run a headless browser.

Your Node.js environment is now set up, and you can run the provided Puppeteer code by following the steps above.

# Puppeteer Automation Documentation

The provided code snippet uses Puppeteer, a Node.js library for automating interactions with web pages. This code demonstrates how to navigate to a web page, interact with elements, and automate actions on the "https://www.okx.com/account/register" registration page. Below is a breakdown of the code:

1. Import the Puppeteer library:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
```

2. Define the target URL:

```javascript
const url = "https://www.okx.com/account/register";
```

3. Launch a headless Chrome browser and create a new page:

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();
```

4. Navigate to the target URL:

```javascript
await page.goto(url);
```

5. Wait for an element with the class "login-tabs-pane-list-flex-shrink" to appear:

```javascript
await page.waitForSelector('.login-tabs-pane-list-flex-shrink');
```

6. Click on the "Email" tab:

```javascript
await page.evaluate(() => {
    const elements = document.getElementsByClassName('login-tabs-pane-list-flex-shrink')[0].children;
    elements[1].click();
});
```

7. Focus on the email input field:

```javascript
await page.evaluate(() => {
    const inputElement = document.getElementsByClassName('login-input-box account-input-wrapper')[0].children[1];
    if (inputElement) {
        inputElement.focus();
    }
});
```

8. Type the email into the input field using the keyboard:

```javascript
await page.keyboard.type('mocha@gmail.com');
```

9. Trigger a blur event to simulate clicking outside:

```javascript
await page.evaluate(() => {
    const inputElement = document.getElementsByClassName('login-input-box account-input-wrapper')[0].children[1];
    if (inputElement) {
        const blurEvent = new Event('blur', { bubbles: true });
        inputElement.dispatchEvent(blurEvent);
    }
});
```

10. Click the "Submit" button with the id "register-submit-btn":

```javascript
await page.click('#register-submit-btn');
```

11. Wait for the "Submit" button to disappear:

```javascript
await page.waitForSelector('#register-submit-btn', { hidden: true, timeout: 5000 }).catch(() => {});
```

12. Check if the element with the class "verify-input-container" is now on the page:

```javascript
const verifyInputContainerExists = await page.$('.verify-input-container');
```

13. If the element exists, enter a verification code:

```javascript
if (verifyInputContainerExists) {
    let verificationCode = "129031";
    const codeSections = await page.$$('.code-section');

    for (let i = 0; i < codeSections.length; i++) {
        const inputElement = await codeSections[i].$('input[type="tel"]');
        await inputElement.type(verificationCode.slice(i, i + 1));
    }
}
```

14. Optionally, perform a click action (based on a condition):

```javascript
let iSet = false;
if (iSet) {
    await page.evaluate(() => {
        const loginElement = document.getElementsByClassName('login')[0];
        loginElement.click();
    });
}
```

15. Close the browser:

```javascript
await browser.close();
```

This code demonstrates how to automate a series of interactions on a web page using Puppeteer. You can modify the code to automate similar interactions on other web pages as needed.
